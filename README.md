# FastAPI Example

Sample CRUD API using FastAPI, Pydantic models and settings, and SQLite as database.

The API works with a "User" and "Expense" entity. 
It implements authentication using JSON Web Tokens.

## Endpoints

Endpoints define the whole CRUD operations that can be performed on Expense entities:

- GET `/docs` - OpenAPI documentation (generated by FastAPI)
- POST `/expenses` - create a new expense
- GET `/expenses/{id}` - get a single expense by its unique ID
- PUT `/expenses/{id}` - update an existing expense
- DELETE `/expenses/{id}` - delete an existing expense

Endpoints for User entities:

- GET `/users/{id}` - get a single user by its unique ID
- POST `/users` - create a new user

Endpoint for Authentication:
- POST `/login` - authenticate user
